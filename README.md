**Stakeholder Profile**:  
Frank, 22, is a fellow NYU student who has been working out for six months. While he is committed to his fitness routine, he feels that his approach lacks structure and progress has been slower than expected. He is looking for ways to train more effectively and track his progress in a structured way.

**Goals/Needs**:  
1. **Establish a Structured Workout Routine**: Mark wants a clear and systematic workout plan to follow, ensuring he is targeting the right muscle groups and progressing efficiently.
2. **Track Progress Over Time**: He is interested in seeing how his strength and endurance improve, particularly in terms of weight lifted and workout duration.
3. **Optimize Rest Periods and Workout Time**: Time management is important to him, and he wants to ensure he's not wasting time between sets or during his workouts.
4. **Stay Motivated**: Mark finds it hard to stay motivated without seeing tangible progress, so he needs a way to visualize his gains and stay on track.

**Problems/Frustrations**:  
1. **Lack of Organization**: His workouts feel unorganized, and he often goes to the gym without a clear plan, which affects his consistency and results.
2. **Difficulty Tracking Progress**: Mark has no easy way to log his performance during workouts, leading to uncertainty about whether he's improving or plateauing.
3. **Unsure About Proper Form**: He is concerned about whether he's performing exercises correctly, which might lead to injury or hinder his progress.
4. **Hard to Measure Gains**: Without a way to easily track and visualize his growth, Mark sometimes feels demotivated, unsure if his efforts are paying off.


**Stakeholder Profile**:  
Sarah, 21, is an NYU student who has been focusing on improving her fitness by losing weight while also building her athletic ability. Her goal isn't just weight loss; she wants to enhance her overall endurance and strength through a combination of aerobic exercises and strength training. Sarah is relatively new to structured workouts and seeks guidance on balancing both aspects of her fitness journey.

**Goals/Needs**:  
1. **Combine Weight Loss with Athletic Training**: Sarah wants a plan that not only helps her lose weight but also boosts her overall fitness, including strength and endurance.
2. **Track Both Strength and Cardio Metrics**: She needs a way to measure progress in both her aerobic capacity and strength, ensuring her workouts are balanced.
3. **Customize Workout Plans for Dual Goals**: Sarah wants a workout routine that targets fat loss and improves her sports performance, but she finds it challenging to balance the two effectively.
4. **Stay Engaged with Varied Workouts**: To prevent boredom and stay motivated, Sarah prefers varied workout routines that include strength training, cardio, and sport-specific exercises.

**Problems/Frustrations**:  
1. **Difficulty Balancing Cardio and Strength**: Sarah finds it hard to strike a balance between strength training and aerobic exercises, often feeling unsure which to prioritize during her gym sessions.
2. **Plateau in Weight Loss**: She feels like she's hitting a plateau in her weight loss journey and wants to make sure she's progressing in both fitness and weight management.
3. **Struggling to Measure Performance**: Sarah finds it challenging to quantify her improvements in athletic ability, especially with tracking endurance or sports-related metrics.
4. **Boredom with Repetitive Workouts**: Doing the same workouts repeatedly leads to a lack of motivation, making it harder for her to stick to a routine
